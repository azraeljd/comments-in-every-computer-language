# Comments in Every Computer Language Contributing Guide
Thank you for your interest on contributing to Comments in Every Computer Language.
Before you contribute, please read this contributing guide.
## Guidelines
### When contributing a new language
- You must provide a link to the language's website and Git repository (if available).
- You must make an example program that prints "Hello, World!". You can use the code
provided in [the Hello World collection](https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world).
- You must write inline comments in the line that prints "Hello, World!"
- Indentation and spacing must be 4 spaces wide, unless the language has a specific
requirement for indentation widths.
- You must add the language to the [list of languages](_docs/list-of-languages.md).
### When adding a new version of a language
Computer languages may differ from a version to another, for example: Python 2 and
Python 3 have different syntaxes. When adding a new version of a language, you must
create the file according to the language version, for example: `python_2.py` for
comments in Python 2, and `python_3.py` for comments in Python 3.
### Libraries and Frameworks
A lot of programming languages have libraries or frameworks, for example JavaScript
libraries which are displayed as a different language in
[GitHub Linguist](../../../../github/linguist). Libraries and frameworks should not
have their own comments, unless their comment syntax is different from the original
programming language.
